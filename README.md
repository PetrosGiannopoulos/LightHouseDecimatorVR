# LightHouseDecimatorVR
A VR Game made in GameJam 2018. My role in this project was to create and manage the movement of the friendly ships in an ellipsoidal course. This was done using splines. Also made the enemy ships to follow and try to destroy them if they are too close. The friendly ships cycle their waypoint locations randomly but always have a different waypoint.
